API Overview
Our API is available for everyone to use. A TMDB user account is required to request an API key. Professional users are approved on a per application basis.

As always, you must attribute TMDB as the source of your data. Please be sure to read more about this here.

API Documentation
To view all the methods available, you should head over to developers.themoviedb.org. Everything outlined on this page is simply a high level overview to help you understand what is available.

Why would I need an API?
The API provides a fast, consistent and reliable way to get third party data. -->
